What design decisions did you make in your rulesets that made this assignment easier or harder? Why?
I change the wovyn_base ruleset to directly get values from sensor_profile. By doing so, I am able to have a single place to store all of the tracked and changable values

Explain how the sensor_profile ruleset isolates state and processes regarding the sensor profile from other rulesets. 
The state is isolated within sensor_profile and no other action outsied ruleset can change it

How do other rulesets use the sensor_profile to get data?
Other rulesets are using sensor_profile as a module to get the data from it

Could they use it to store new values? How?
Yes, we can use sensor_profile to store values. We just need to add that entity variable to store it
